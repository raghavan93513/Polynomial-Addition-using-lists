# Polynomial-Addition-using-lists
Write an algorithm and the subsequent Python program to add the two given polynomials. Assume that the coefficients of each polynomial are stored in a separate list.  Eg: 4x3 + 3x + 1 can be stored as [4,0,3,1]  2x2 - 3x - 4 can be stored as [2,-3,-4]  Output is [4, 2, 0, -3]
